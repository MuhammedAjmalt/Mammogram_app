# ü©ª Mammogram Image Analysis Web App

This project is a web-based application that uses a YOLOv5 deep learning model to analyze mammogram images for potential abnormalities. The app provides both visual insights and a downloadable PDF report of the findings to aid medical professionals in diagnostics.

## üöÄ Features

- üîç **YOLOv5-based Detection**: Utilizes a pretrained YOLOv5 model to detect abnormalities in mammogram images.
- üñºÔ∏è **Side-by-side Display**: Original and processed image views for easy comparison.
- üìÑ **PDF Report Generation**: Downloadable report containing diagnostic results.
- üåê **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Flask and styled using Bootstrap for a clean and responsive layout.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Visual Risk Indicators**: BIRADS classification labels displayed with alert levels (e.g., `birads2`, `birads5`).

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mammogram-analysis-app.git
   cd mammogram-analysis-app
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download YOLOv5**
   This app uses a custom-trained YOLOv5 model (`best.pt`). Make sure `yolov5` is cloned and added to your project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
   ```
